Hello.
I don't see myself much as a *programmer* so I'll just talk about what I like.

I like movies, some of my favorite being the following:

- A Streetcar Named Desire
- Roman Holiday
- Edward Scissorhands
- Rocco and His Brothers
- The Man From Nowhere

I also like novels. Out of the ones I've read so far, here's my list of favorite books:

1. The Great Gatsby
2. The Catcher In The Rye
3. The Little Prince
4. Frankenstein
5. To Kill A Mockingbird

I used to listen to a lot of Elvis songs and interviews in highschool. One of my favorite quotes of his goes like this:

>You only pass through this life once, you don't come back for an encore.


Here's my bucket list.
- [ ] Skydiving
- [x] Watching a black and white movie in a theater
- [x] Staying awake for more than 24 hours
- [ ] Staying a week in Paris
- [ ] Seeing a meteor shower

Lastly, a quiz:
Guess what the following code would print.

    void zero(int x) {
        x = 0;
    }

    int main() {
        int myInt = 42;
        zero(myInt);
        cout << myInt;
    }

I got a lot of help from the [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to create this page.
