Create a new file called index.md. This is where you'll create your User Page, which should include content that introduces who you are as a programmer and as a person. Your User Page must be made with Markdown. For this assignment, your page must include the following:

    Pictures

    Links to an external site.
        Headings o
        Styling text o

        Quoting code o
        External Links o
        Section links o
        Relative links (Link to another .md file or an image in your repo. If linking to an image, encode it as a regular link rather than an image.) o
        Ordered and Unordered Lists o
        Task lists o

Once you are finished, publish your web page through Github Pages - instructions here

I don't see myself much as a programmer so I'll just talk about what I like.
I like movies, some of my favorite being *Edward Scissorhands*, *Rocco and His Brothers*, and *The Man From Nowhere*.
